# Easy-Budget
This program is designed to take user input on their budget information and output it into an Excel spreadsheet.
The program prompts the user to give information on their assets in their bank account and wallet, as well as their
current expenses. It then takes that information and displays it on an Excel spreadsheet, so the user can easily
determine how best to budget their money based on how much they have, and how much they spend.
